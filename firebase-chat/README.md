Welcome to the Firebase Chat App built with Next.js 14 and Tailwind CSS! This real-time chat application integrates Firebase for authentication and Firestore for managing messages.

     storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
     messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
     appId: "YOUR_APP_ID",
   };

   if (!firebase.apps.length) {
     firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
   }

   export const auth = firebase.auth();
